Usage: find-script-command command [grep-options...]

Finds a script command in arx script files.

For optimum perfomance cd to graph/obj3d/interactive and then run e.g.
 find-script-command teleport

This script will automatically searcg for all different encodings of the
command, ignoring case and adding as many underscores as needed.
The provided command should *not* already contain any underscores.

It will however not actually parse scripts so false positive matches
(for example in strings and comments) are very much possible.

# Some grep/pcre versions can't deal with invalid UTF-8 sequences!

# ASCII for script command names, use the "C" locale - others aren't guaranteed to
# be available.
