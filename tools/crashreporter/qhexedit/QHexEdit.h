/*!
 * QHexEdit is a hex editor widget written in C++ for the Qt (Qt4) framework.
 * It is a simple editor for binary data, just like QPlainTextEdit is for text
 * data. There are sip configuration files included, so it is easy to create
 * bindings for PyQt and you can use this widget also in python.
 *
 * QHexEdit takes the data of a QByteArray (setData()) and shows it. You can use
 * the mouse or the keyboard to navigate inside the widget. If you hit the keys
 * (0..9, a..f) you will change the data. Changed data is highlighted and can be
 * accessed via data().
 *
 * Normaly QHexEdit works in the overwrite Mode. You can set overwriteMode(false)
 * and insert data. In this case the size of data() increases. It is also possible
 * to delete bytes (del or backspace), here the size of data decreases.
 *
 * You can select data with keyboard hits or mouse movements. The copy-key will
 * copy the selected data into the clipboard. The cut-key copies also but delets
 * it afterwards. In overwrite mode, the paste function overwrites the content of
 * the (does not change the length) data. In insert mode, clipboard data will be
 * inserted. The clipboard content is expected in ASCII Hex notation. Unknown
 * characters will be ignored.
 *
 * QHexEdit comes with undo/redo functionality. All changes can be undone, by
 * pressing the undo-key (usually ctr-z). They can also be redone afterwards.
 * The undo/redo framework is cleared, when setData() sets up a new
 * content for the editor.
 *
 * This widget can only handle small amounts of data. The size has to be below 10
 * megabytes, otherwise the scroll sliders ard not shown and you can't scroll any
 * more.
