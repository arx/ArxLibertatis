# Try to find the GLEW library and include path.
# Once done this will define
#
# GLEW_FOUND
# GLEW_INCLUDE_DIR   Where to find GL/glew.h
# GLEW_LIBRARIES     The glew library library
# GLEW_DEFINITIONS   Definitions to use when compiling code that uses glew
#
# Typical usage could be something like:
#   find_package(GLEW REQUIRED)
#   include_directories(SYSTEM ${GLEW_INCLUDE_DIR})
#   add_definitions(${GLEW_DEFINITIONS})
#   ...
#   target_link_libraries(myexe ${GLEW_LIBRARIES})
#
# The following additional options can be defined before the find_package() call:
# GLEW_USE_STATIC_LIBS  Statically link against glew (default: OFF)
#
# Adapted from:
