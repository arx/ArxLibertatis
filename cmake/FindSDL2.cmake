# Try to find the SDL2 library and include path.
# Once done this will define
#
# SDL2_FOUND
# SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR   Where to find SDL.h
# SDL2_LIBRARY       The libSDL2 library only
# SDL2_LIBRARIES     All libraries to link against for SDL2
#
# Typical usage could be something like:
#   find_package(SDL2 REQUIRED)
#   include_directories(SYSTEM ${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR})
#   ...
#   target_link_libraries(myexe ${SDL2_LIBRARIES})
#
# The following additional options can be defined before the find_package() call:
# SDL2_USE_STATIC_LIBS  Statically link against libsdl2 (default: OFF)
# SDL2_BUILDING_LIBRARY Don't link against SDL2main - this means the user is responsible
#                       for abstracting their own main() from OS-specific entry points.
#
# For macOS, this module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.
#
# $SDL2DIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDL2DIR
# used in building SDL2.
#
#
# Modified by Eric Wing.
# Added code to assist with automated building by using environmental variables
# and providing a more controlled/consistent search behavior.
# Added new modifications to recognize macOS frameworks and
# additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
# Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL guidelines.
# Added a search for SDL2main which is needed by some platforms.
# Added a search for threads which is needed by some platforms.
# Added needed compile switches for MinGW.
#
# On macOS, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
# People will have to manually change the cache values of
# SDL2_LIBRARY to override this selection or set the CMake environment
# CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.
#
# Note that the header path has changed from SDL2/SDL.h to just SDL.h
# This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention
# is #include "SDL.h", not <SDL2/SDL.h>. This is done for portability
# reasons because not all systems place things in SDL2/ (see FreeBSD).
