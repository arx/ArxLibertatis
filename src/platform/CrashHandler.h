 * \brief Handle crashes and collect as much info as possible in order to ease bug fixing.
 *
 * This class relies on a crash reporter, which is second process that gets started
 * when a crash occurs. The crash reporter has two purpose:
 *    * Collect information on the crashed process in a safer environment.
 *    * Report the crash to the user or developpers (console, network, db, etc.)
 *
 * You can attach files to the crash report using addAttachedFile(). Those will be
 * included in the crash report. Note that some of these files might still be
 * opened when a crash occurs. To handle this case, you can also register callbacks
 * using registerCrashCallback() to be notified of a crash and take the appropriate
 * actions (for example, close a log file).
 *
 * Another nice feature allows you to add variables to the crash report.
 * For example, you might want to set a variable to know the last loaded level, the
 * amount of health, the last spell casted... see setVariable() for more details.
