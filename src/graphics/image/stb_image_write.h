   writes out PNG/BMP/TGA images to C stdio - Sean Barrett 2010

ABOUT:

   This header file is a library for writing images to C stdio. It could be
   adapted to write to memory or a general streaming interface; let me know.

   The PNG output is not optimal; it is 20-50% larger than the file
   written by a decent optimizing implementation. This library is designed
   for source code compactness and simplicitly, not optimal image file size
   or run-time performance.

USAGE:

   There are three functions, one for each image file format:

     int stbi_write_png(char const *filename, int w, int h, int comp, const void *data, int stride_in_bytes);
     int stbi_write_bmp(char const *filename, int w, int h, int comp, const void *data);
     int stbi_write_tga(char const *filename, int w, int h, int comp, const void *data);

   Each function returns 0 on failure and non-0 on success.
   
   The functions create an image file defined by the parameters. The image
   is a rectangle of pixels stored from left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
   Each pixel contains 'comp' channels of data stored interleaved with 8-bits
   per channel, in the following order: 1=Y, 2=YA, 3=RGB, 4=RGBA. (Y is
   monochrome color.) The rectangle is 'w' pixels wide and 'h' pixels tall.
   The *data pointer points to the first byte of the top-left-most pixel.
   For PNG, "stride_in_bytes" is the distance in bytes from the first byte of
   a row of pixels to the first byte of the next row of pixels.

   PNG creates output files with the same number of components as the input.
   The BMP and TGA formats expand Y to RGB in the file format. BMP does not
   output alpha.
   
   PNG supports writing rectangles of data even when the bytes storing rows of
   data are not consecutive in memory (e.g. sub-rectangles of a larger image),
   by supplying the stride between the beginning of adjacent rows. The other
   formats do not. (Thus you cannot write a native-format BMP through the BMP
   writer, both because it is in BGR order and because it may have padding
   at the end of the line.)
