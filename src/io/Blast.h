 * is returned.  If there is not enough input available or there is not enough
 * output space, then a positive error is returned.
 *
 * The input function is invoked: len = infun(how, &buf), where buf is set by
 * infun() to point to the input buffer, and infun() returns the number of
 * available bytes there.  If infun() returns zero, then blast() returns with
 * an input error.  (blast() only asks for input if it needs it.)  inhow is for
 * use by the application to pass an input descriptor to infun(), if desired.
 *
 * The output function is invoked: err = outfun(how, buf, len), where the bytes
 * to be written are buf[0..len-1].  If err is not zero, then blast() returns
 * with an output error.  outfun() is always called with len <= 4096.  outhow
 * is for use by the application to pass an output descriptor to outfun(), if
 * desired.
 *
 * At the bottom of blast.c is an example program that uses blast() that can be
 * compiled to produce a command-line decompression filter by defining TEST.
