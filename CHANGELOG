  below 640x480
* Linux: Merged the data install script and set it to be installed it with
  the arx binary

  if needed - you no longer need to use the terminal to install the game data
  under Linux!

  script (bug #348)
* Linux: Translated the .desktop file to French, German and Russian
* Restored some unused spell sounds

Technical Changes:

* A *lot* of code cleanup

  might be slight changes in corner cases. (task #353)
* Changed to always create a user/config directory in the user's home
  directory unless explicitly changed with the --user-dir and/or --config-dir
  options or registry keys. Previously, if no data and user directories were

* Removed dependency on the proprietary PKWARE implode library
** This required changing the savegame format - saves produced by
   Arx Libertatis cannot be read by the original Arx Fatalis, but
   Arx Libertatis can still read the original save files.
* Abstracted windowing framework, with SDL and Win32 implementations
* Abstracted audio backend, with OpenAL and DirectSound 9 implementations
* Abstracted input backend, with SDL and DirectInput 8 implementations
* Abstracted renderer backend, with OpenGL and Direct3D 9 implementations
* Replaced custom image loading/saving code with DevIL
